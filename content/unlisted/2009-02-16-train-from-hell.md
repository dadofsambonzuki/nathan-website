For the sake of Man, please make it stop.

I'm being noise polluted to death and no, I'm not joking. I think it may just be possible to die. I am contemplating swallowing my own tongue.

Here is what I'm being subjected to right now:
<ul>
	<li>Bad Vietnamese caberet being force fed to us on the train's PA system, backed up by visuals on the distant TV.</li>
	<li>Local music being played loudly by the chap 2 rows back through his tinny and crackling cassette player.</li>
	<li>A cockral a-cocking! I shit you not.</li>
</ul>
Laura's chair only has 1 setting: fully reclined. Oh, and the air con has packed up!

On the bright side, there are only 8 more hours to go.

All part of the allure of travelling, or so I'm told. ;)
