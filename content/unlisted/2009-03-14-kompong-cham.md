After another stressfull bus ride! A 2 hour wait for it to turn up and stopping every 5 minutes for the first hour to take on more people onto the ready crammed bus - we arrived in Kompong Cham way later and much sweatier than expected!

After checking-in to one of the few hotels around we headed out straight to the nearest restaurant and devoured lunch of fish & chips and spag bol!

Kampong Cham is not really a destination in itself, but just a stop off between Siem Reap and Kratie. As such, there's not much going on, but it was really refreshing not to be hassled with shouts of "you buy" and "Sir tuc-tuc, Sir". In fact there were only 2 tuc-tucs in the whole town. The place had a really friendly feel to it and we were greated more than once as we walked through town, often in French, which I loved!

After lunch we took a stroll down to the only real sight in the town: the Bamboo Bridge. This is a man-made bridge across the Mekong that is built every year from scratch in the Dry Season. It's a source of great pride and the local men compete to have the honour of building it each year.

That was it really. Up again early tomorrow as we're on the move again, this time to Kratie.
