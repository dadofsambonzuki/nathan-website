Getting up to Siem Reap was a longer than expected experience. Our bus broke down :( . We all piled off the bus in the early afternoon Sun and milled around watching our driver fiddle with the engine. It roared back into life after about an hour, but we made slow progress after that, getting into Siem Reap a good few hours late. Our guesthouse had a complimentary pick-up service, which meant our poor tuk-tuk driver had been waiting for us all that time.

Food poisoning at the Dead Fish Cafe. Ry described it as "If Data from the Goonies owned a restaurant, this would be it."

Not that impressed generally with the town - a bit too 18-30's for my liking.
