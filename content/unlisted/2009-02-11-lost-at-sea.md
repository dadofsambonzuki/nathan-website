As I write this we are stuck at sea!

We're on our way back from Cat Ba Island and although the Sun is beaming, there is a low fog that is hugging the sea and rocks.

After waiting for about an hour for the mist to drift by, I playfully asked Duke if the captain had any charts. Unsuprisingly the answer was no as I was told the captain used his knowledge of the rocks and experience of the bay to navigate. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a big believer of experience and learning from the scars of life, but it doesn't count for shit when you're floating about in 30m visabilty on the South China Sea!!

I'd offered the captain use of the GPS on my phone, but got a bemused look in return. I guess knowing where you are now isn't much use when you don't know where you're heading.

The engines have just re-started, I can spy a rock on the horizon!
