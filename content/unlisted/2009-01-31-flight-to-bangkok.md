So, 3 hours to go of the 11 hour flight to Bangkok.

The flight hasn't been to bad, although my new Zen state is being tested as I'm flanked by a middle aged, overweight Aussie who has little regard for the boundry between my seat and his. This particular Aussie also comes with a stream of other middle aged Aussies who visit regularly to say c**t. Nice!

Me and Lau had a final British pint at Heathrow before boarding. I went with a pint of ale as a figured there wouldn't be much of that where we're going, Lau on the other hand ... "I'll have a Stella, that's British"! I pointed out that getting blind drunk on Stella was British, but we didn't have time for that ;)

This travelling lark is all feeling extremely real now. I very rarely get nervous or aprehensive, but there was an hour or so at the airport where my stomach was doing back flips. I think more because of what I'm leaving behind rather than what lies ahead.

Righto, off to watch another mediocre film with the right elbow of a fat man in my rib cage ...
