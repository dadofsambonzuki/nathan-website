About 15km north of Siagon is an area called Chu Chi. There was a big pocket of VC resistance here throughout the war, aided by the infamous network of underground tunnels.

The Americans unwittingly build a base over part of the network and kept being attacked from within.

We took a tour around them with Lee, leaving Nam chatting with his old enemies back at the gatehouse as the place is run by the military.

First stop was a quick film and a healthy dose of propaganda. Here are a few quotes I picked up, you've got to admire the objective impartiality:

"The crazy bunch of American devils attacked ... "

"This man was awarded the Heroic Medal for Killing Americans."

Weaving through B52 bomb craters, we were then taken on a tour of the actual tunnels themselves.

They showed us one of the original trap door entrances, they are tiny. Lee got involved and in doing so showed me the technique of fitting down inside the small rectangular hole. I eased myself in - hands in the air until inside - and then as soon as I dropped in I was cloaked in darkness as the guide closed the entrance! WTF! A mild sense of panic rose up inside me, but I followed a dim light and the smell of fresh air to another exit just down the tunnel. I love the total disregard for health and safety in Asia!

We then went through a series if longer and deeper holes. Lau did well and relevtantly went down a few of them, although there was no hiding the shear fear in her eyes. I got some great photos!

At one point me and Lee were scuttling down one of the longer and deeper tunnels when a few bats passed us at very close quarters.

Very cool morning, but not for the clausterphobic!
