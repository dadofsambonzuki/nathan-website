Today has been a perfect day. I'm writing this in my hammock on the veranda of our bungalow having just watched the sun set with Lau on the beach.

After a lazy breakfast of pancakes and muslei we headed to The Other beach - the beach at the opposite side of the Island. It took us about 20 minutes or so, navigating our way through the sometimes thick jungle.

The Other Beach is much bigger than Lazy beach and the white sand slowly disapears into the sea. At any one point there were only ever two other people on the beach, which arched for 2km around the bay.

We got talking about the future; where we might live, what our house might look like, how many kids we would like. We carried on our chat as we headed to the sea to cool ourselves from the heat of the early afternoon Sun and the conversation slowly turned toward marraige. We talked about being together and after a while I found myself probing for some signals from Lau that it was OK to ask her to marry me. It came from nowhere and wasn't premeditated, but the urge came quicky  and without much thought. The turn in conversation caught us both off gaurd and we were both grinning our way through it. I remember it vividly as Lau had her body wrapped around mine as is usual when we are in the water together. I love that she does this. It makes me feel loved.

We stopped short of getting engaged, but made a comittment to each other to make each other happy for the rest of our lives. It felt warm and special, the two of us sat there entangled in the crystal clear sea.

We then made love right there in the sea. It was good sex and I felt as close to Lau as I ever have. It wasn't until the last moments that I realised there was a couple from the resort on the beach less than 100m away - never mind ay!

I don't think we'll figure out if marraige does mean anything to Us anytime soon. I think it is endemic (symptomatic) of our long relationship. As the pressure to get married comes and then goes, I think it somehow takes away some of it's magic.

I believe it when I'm told that it's every girls dream to get married and so I'd like to find a way to put the allure back.. Then again, the thought of having a life and family with Lau without being married is appealing. I like the message it carries: you don't have to legally bound to enjoy family life with the one you love.

I think we at least made a step closer to figuring it out today, still a way to go though me thinks.
