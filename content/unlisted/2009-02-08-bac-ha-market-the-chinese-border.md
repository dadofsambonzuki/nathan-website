Yesterday we went to Bac Ha Market, which is about 4 hours drive from Sapa. What a cool place.

We spent the day with Nancy, an American med student we'd met on the bus up to Sapa.

All of the village tribes come down from the mountains to exchange goods - anything from shoes to pigs.

We've got some awesome photos. One man has a wooden cage on the back of his scooter with about 8 pigs inside. One that we didn't get was a scooter with a <strong>full grown</strong> pig strapped to the back! His front wheel was pulling up as he set off up the hill!

After the market we went to visit a mountain village, but it was a little bit Disneyland stylee as there were bus loads of tourists trapsing through. Plus we'd had our fill of tribal villages on the Sapa trek.

On the way back to the train station we stopped at the Chinese border, which was kinda cool. The others on the tour were fairly excited and an Aussie girl pushed her luck a little and got told to step back ... we'll be doing the real thing in about 4 months or so!

We ended the day drinking beer and playing cards at a street cafe with Nancy, whilst waiting for our sleeper train back to Hanoi.
