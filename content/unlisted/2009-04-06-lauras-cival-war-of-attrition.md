Laura continues her very own civil war of attrition with yet more self inflicted injuries.

To add to her various cuts, burns, lumps and bruises she now has a sprained ankle!

We were strolling around Chiang Rai, which incidentally is a cool little place, in search of a massage when we passed a small car workshop. A few dogs started growling and before I knew it Lau was on her ass and in a serious amount of pain. Within under a minute she had been whisked in to what can only be described as a midget's deck chair and had an ice pack being held to her ankle by the very motherly lady of the house! They were so kind and helpful and at one point the lady buzzed off on her moped and returned 5 mins later with anesthetic cream and a bandage. They would not accept a single Baht from us.

Lau hopped out of the hotel this morning with her rucksack on ... she's off to meet Kaz & Em down in Puhket for a few days.
