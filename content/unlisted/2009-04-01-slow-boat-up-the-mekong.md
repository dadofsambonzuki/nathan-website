We took the slow boat up the Mekong from Luang Prabang to Huay Xai. I've been wanting to do a Mekong trip for a while now.

We spent 8 hours a day for 2 days winding our way North. It was a pretty relaxing and uneventful trip, apart from some rain and neo-conservatism.

I had a very brief conversation with an old-timer American. He dressed in classic summer hunting attire, hat and all. Like a character straight out of a 80's film starring John Candy (God rest his soul) or Chevy Chase. I managed to grab a clandestine picture:

<a href="/media/2009/04/l-640-480-a338630e-6eab-408b-b83f-49e4d4a4ece5.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-364" src="/media/2009/04/l-640-480-a338630e-6eab-408b-b83f-49e4d4a4ece5.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>

The chat went something like this:

<strong>Me:</strong> "... we ended up eating in the Indian place last night. It was a really goo ..."
<strong>Old-timer:</strong> "I don't like Indians so much."
<strong>Me:</strong> "Oh, why's that?"
<strong>Old-timer:</strong> "And I'll be damned if I'll do business with them."
<strong>Me: </strong>"Have you been to India?"
<strong>Old-timer: </strong>"No, but in Bangkok they are everywhere. Always popping up trying to sell you a suit."
<strong>Me:</strong> "Riiiight ..."
<strong>Old-timer:</strong> "The kinda pressure sell just don't work in America. One of them grabbed my arm, that's Battery back home."
<strong>Me: </strong>"Well, I guess your not in America now. The rules are different here."
<strong>Old-timer: </strong>"Actually, I heard that those sellers might not be Indians ... that they're Pakistani or something - Muslims."

This next bit is verbatim. I shit you not.

<strong>Old-timer:</strong> "I think they [Muslims] harass Westerners because of The War on Terror."

<strong>Me</strong> (wry smile)<strong>:</strong> "I highly doubt that".

I'm guessing he's a Republican and a member of the NRA.
