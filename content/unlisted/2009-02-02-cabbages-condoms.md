Just had dinner at a place called Cabbages and Condoms. It's a charity setup to help out Thai women. The Gates Foundation gave it £1M recently.

The food was excellent and the tables were set outside where we were surrounded by plants and trees.

Oh, and there was the occasional sculpture made out of jonnies! I like the one attached of Santa.
