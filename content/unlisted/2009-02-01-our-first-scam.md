Fresh off the boat and we were shown no mercy!

Contrary to Lau's meticulous plan, we were being whisked around various Buddas and retail outlets within 5 minutes of leaving our hotel!

I think the order was thus:

Standing Budda - quite impressive.
Tailor - you buy suit, Sir.
Lucky Budda (the irony)
Jeweller - you buy Ruby for Madam, Sir.
Black Budda
Stop - take us to the Sky Train chief, we've got a plan to get back to.

And the cost of this deceipt ... 50p! Damn you pesky seemingly helpful Thai man helping us with our map.

To be fair Lau called it early to my protests of going with the flow and "he seemed really genuine". Sucker.

It won't be our last!

Later in the day we went to the vast markets at Chatuchak and ate Pad Thai at a street stall before heading back to our Hotel, stopping off for a 1h full body Thai massage of course.
