I was at <a title="BarCamp Sheffield" href="http://barcampsheffield.net/" target="_blank">BarCamp Sheffield</a> a few weeks ago and I posted a session on the planning wall entitled "tools and techniques to aid multi-site working". The driver here was to try and get the high-bandwidth comms we get within a project (<a title="Rockshore" href="http://rockshore.net" target="_blank">Rockshore</a> are fans of the eXtreme Programming methodology) across multiple projects and include the guys from the other areas of the business.

I have recently started to use twitter and I asked they guys that turned up for the session if there was a business version of micro-blogging ... I suppose in the same way LinkedIN is the business social networking equivalent of Facebook. One of the friendly guys over at <a title="locallycompared.com" href="http://locallycompared.com" target="_blank">locallycompared.com</a> suggest we try out <a title="Yammer" href="https://www.yammer.com" target="_blank">Yammer</a> ... so we did.

We've now been using it for a couple of weeks using various clients (SMS, Web, iPhone, IM and Desktop) and I'm impressed. It really helps us all catch-up on a semi-continous basis ... not quite like all being in the same place, but a good step towards it. I think this high-bandwith comms is crucial to keep a small and growing business in-sync when we can be working on 5 projects and 10 sales opportunities at any one time.

Give it a go!
