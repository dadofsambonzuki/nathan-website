This time our bus broke down 3 times as it attempted to get from Kompong Cham to Kratie. It was also crammed with locals who sat on small plastic stools in the aisles and so was a tad claustrophobic. I had a woman on a stool next to me with a screaming toddler. Nice. I have now adopted an almost Zen state when traveling on buses, it is key to surviving them!

At one of the stops we had all got off the bus and were sat by the side of the road. All the kids were playing together and throwing rocks into a pool by a paddy field. Almost spontaneously everyone started laughing at me and Lau, as 2 of the only 3 Westerners on the bus. There was a lot of staring and more laughing. It was all good natured and they were smiling at us at the same time. I can only imagine that they were thinking what the hell are these guys on the local bus for - they'll on holiday!

The final time the bus stopped the driver and his passenger conscript had to take a belt from the AC (I use the word AC in the loosest possible sense) and use it for the engine. The last few hours of the journey were spent in my happy place.
