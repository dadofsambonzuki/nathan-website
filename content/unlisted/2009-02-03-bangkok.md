Just on the toilet in Hanoi airport and thought I'd use the time effectively!

Yesterday we took a river bus out to the Reclining Budda, Grand Palace and the Emerald Budda, all very grand. I had to queue for an hour as I had to rent some trousers as shorts were a no no.

We eat a lunch of sticky rice and bbq chicken at a steet cafe. Nothing soecial, but at 65 baht (£1.20) I wasn't complaining.

After a quick snooze we headed out to Paragon Mall to meet Mike & Cha for dinner. Laura use to work with Mike at Centrica. We ended up eating at the place next to the hostel Laura stayed at last time she was here. I had a whole Sea Bass .... mmmmm.

We had an intetesting start to the day today with a narcoleptic taxi driver taking us to the airport! Me and Lau were chatting as we were sat in Bangkok traffic and we heard this snoring sound from the front. This was to happen virtually every time we stopped!!

Highlights for me were:

First meal on the street - the energy of the street, the smell of food that permeates Bangkok and the realisation that we were actually away, finally.
