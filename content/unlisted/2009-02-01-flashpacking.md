I think our first hotel (www.lamphutreehotel.com) pretty much hits the mark as the definition of flashpacking.

Flower Juice on arrival
Pool
Americans saying "oh my goodness"
Free wifi - a number if guests seem to have tiny laptops and iPhones (I thought I would be the only loser!)
Breakfast of fresh fruit, bacon, eggs and coffee served to you at the table on the veranda.
Preppy Americans in Chinos
Large LCD in the bar showing Larry King on CNN and the impeachment of the Illinois Governer (not that I'm watching it or anything as I'm listening to Lau talk about Temples. I am.)

Which all add up to a dizzyingly high 11th place on Trip Advisor ... I'll be voting to keep it there.
