We've just been for a drink at The Dome bar on the 64th floor of some posh hotel. Aparently the attached restaurant is the highest open air restaurant in the world.

The entry cost: a pair of shoes! Being a posh hotel, they don't let flip flop clad travellers like us in. They do however let you in if you buy a pair of the cheapest looking shoes (check them out, they had velcro!) from a very nice lady at the shoe shop around the corner.

So, at the second attempt we were in and all bad memories of trying to get in clubs as a kid ebbed away (Xanadu anyone!!).

The views were well worth the shoes though, although the Mojito wasn't quite up to standard.

I popped back to see the nice shoe lady on the way out and gifted her my shoes ... she didn't know quite what to do, but I reckon there is a fair few more entries in them yet.
