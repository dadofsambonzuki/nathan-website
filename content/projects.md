# BTC Map

[BTC Map](https://btcmap.org) is an open-source project that helps Bitcoiners find places to spend their sats.

It's pretty much become *the* place merchants use to list Bitcoin-accepting places since launching in 2022.

My contributions to the project are mainly business, marketing, product and community; although I have been making some coding contributions recently with the help of my friend Claude 😉

# attestr

[attestr](https://attestr.xyz) is an open-source Nostr project I am currently building focused on exploring webs-of-trust. It is - or at least will be - an 'attestations marketplace' based upon the [Attestations](https://nostrhub.io/naddr1qvzqqqrcvypzp384u7n44r8rdq74988lqcmggww998jjg0rtzfd6dpufrxy9djk8qy28wumn8ghj7un9d3shjtnyv9kh2uewd9hsqrrpw36x2um5v96xjmmwwvuhdk8z) protocol extension I have proposed.

Notaries on Nostr if you will.

# Bitfest

I'm one of the co-founders of [Bitfest](https://bitfest.uk) and Nostrshire - a annual, grass-roots Bitcoin and Nostr conference in the UK. 

# gamestr

[gamestr](https://gamestr.io) is a fun side-project I have been building with my son, [Sambonzuki](https://nosta.me/sam@day.ag).

It's a videogame hub that enables games to be listed by makers and players to publish scores on Nostr. This creates global leaderboards with all of the goodies Nostr brings in terms of commenting and zapping. 

We also created [blockstr](https://blockstr.io) as the first game on gamestr.
