Welcome to my new website built with Hugo and the hugo-coder theme!

This is my first post. I'm excited to share my tinkering adventures, projects, and thoughts here.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Technology and development
- Projects I'm working on
- Things I'm learning
- Random musings

Stay tuned for more content!
