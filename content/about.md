Hi, I'm Nathan Day - a tinkerer who loves building things and exploring new technologies.

I'm a Bitcoiner and, more generally, a 'freedom maximalist'. Freedom technologies like Bitcoin and Nostr take-up most of my time currently.

This is my personal corner of the Internet where I share my thoughts, projects, and learnings.

Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:nathan@day.ag) or I'm active on [Nostr](https://nosta.me/nprofile1qqsvfa085adgecmg84ffelcxx6zrn3ffu5jrc6cjtwng0zge3ptv43c82kf5d) and so catch me there!
